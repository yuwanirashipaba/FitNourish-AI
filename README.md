## 🎯 Project Overview

FitNourish AI is an intelligent, AI-powered nutrition assistant designed to address poor dietary habits and the lack of personalized nutrition guidance in existing health applications. Many current diet and fitness apps rely on static recommendations and fail to adapt to users' real-time health data, leading to ineffective diet planning and long-term health issues.

To overcome these limitations, FitNourish AI integrates machine learning, computer vision, and real-time wellness monitoring to deliver personalized, dynamic, and data-driven dietary advice. The system analyzes user profiles, health goals, dietary preferences, and smartwatch biometrics to generate customized meal plans and proactive health alerts.

The platform also incorporates image processing to analyze food photos and suggest suitable meal options, as well as a smart grocery optimizer that creates cost-effective shopping lists aligned with the user's diet plan. By continuously monitoring lifestyle habits and health indicators, FitNourish AI adapts recommendations in real time, ensuring a holistic and user-centric nutrition solution.

</table>


The mobile interface consists of two primary screens:

Nutrition Profile Input Interface

Nutrition Prediction Result Interface

These interfaces guide users through a simple and intuitive workflow—from data entry to AI-generated nutrition insights.

🧑‍⚕️ Nutrition Profile Input Interface

This screen collects essential user health and activity information required for accurate nutrition prediction.

📋 User Inputs

Personal Information
1.Age
2.Gender (Male / Female)
3.Height (cm)
4.Weight (kg)
5.Nutrition Goal
6.Maintain weight
7.Lose weight
8.Gain weight
9.Health Conditions
10.Diabetes (Yes / No)
11.Hypertension (Yes / No)
12.Daily Activity Metrics
13.Steps per day
14.Active minutes
15.Calories burned during activity

🎨 Smart Validation & User Experience (UX)

💪Input validation ensures realistic and medically meaningful values
   (e.g., step count limits, numeric constraints)
💪Toggle buttons and dropdowns are used instead of free-text inputs
💪A green-themed UI aligns with the FitNourish.AI brand identity
💪Mobile-friendly layout enhances usability and clarity

⌚ Smartwatch Data Integration (Demo Logic)

*During first-time setup, users manually enter activity data
*In a real-world deployment, this data is designed to be:
*Automatically fetched from smartwatch or fitness tracker APIs
*Periodically updated to keep nutrition recommendations current

📊 Nutrition Prediction Result Interface

Once the user clicks “Predict & Save”, the validated data is sent to the backend AI system for processing.

🤖 AI-Generated Outputs

❤️Daily Calorie Requirement (kcal/day)
❤️Protein Requirement (g/day)
❤️Carbohydrate Requirement (g/day)
❤️Fat Requirement (g/day)

⚙️ Model & Backend

*Backend Framework: FastAPI (REST API)
*Machine Learning Model: Trained Random Forest Regression Model
*Database: PostgreSQL (stores prediction history and user records)

⭐ Key Highlights

💪Results are displayed using a clear, card-based layout
💪Macro-nutrients are visually separated for easy interpretation
💪Prediction results can be saved and viewed later via the History section
💪Designed for scalability with future health data integrations

🔁 End-to-End Workflow

*User opens the FitNourish.AI mobile application
*Health and activity data are entered or synced from a smartwatch
*Data is validated on the frontend
*Backend AI model processes the input
*Personalized nutrition targets are generated
*Results are displayed and stored for future reference

🎯 Purpose of This Component

1.AI-driven personalization in healthcare and nutrition
2.Integration of frontend, backend, machine learning, and database layers
