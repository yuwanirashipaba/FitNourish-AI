## 🎯 Project Overview

FitNourish AI is an intelligent, AI-powered nutrition assistant designed to address poor dietary habits and the lack of personalized nutrition guidance in existing health applications. Many current diet and fitness apps rely on static recommendations and fail to adapt to users' real-time health data, leading to ineffective diet planning and long-term health issues.

To overcome these limitations, FitNourish AI integrates machine learning, computer vision, and real-time wellness monitoring to deliver personalized, dynamic, and data-driven dietary advice. The system analyzes user profiles, health goals, dietary preferences, and smartwatch biometrics to generate customized meal plans and proactive health alerts.

The platform also incorporates image processing to analyze food photos and suggest suitable meal options, as well as a smart grocery optimizer that creates cost-effective shopping lists aligned with the user's diet plan. By continuously monitoring lifestyle habits and health indicators, FitNourish AI adapts recommendations in real time, ensuring a holistic and user-centric nutrition solution.
